# Automation-car-generator
No idea what to build in Automation? This script will give you ideas!
This is script made to give you inspiration for cars to build in
Automation - The Car Company Tycoon game. I'm planning to add a lot more
options, but for now it will just give you some random cars!

## Usage
Simply make sure you have Python 3.6 or newer installed and run the
`auto.py` file.

## Known issues
As of now, every part is simply randomly chosen, so it's possible you
get an engine placement that is not compatible with the body.
